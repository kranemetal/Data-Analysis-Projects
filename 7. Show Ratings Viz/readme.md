### Below observations were made from the Visualization: <br>

1) **Breaking Bad:** Almost all episodes from all 5 seasons have been loved by audiences, specially the last episode of each season. Moreover second last and last episode of Season 5 are highest rated by users.<br>
  
2) **Dexter:** 6 out of 8 seasons are well received by audiences. Whereas Season 8 seems to be least favorite and Season 6 is second least favorite. The final episode of last season has least rating, perhaps audiences didn't like the way the show ended. <br>
 
3) **Parks and Recreation:** Season 1 and 2 weren't that popular among audiences, it was a bit slow.<br> But Season 3 onwards the show became much more engaging, entertaining and garnered many high ratings from users. <br>
Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) and Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe) two new characters were introduced in end of Season 2, which would become prominent characters on the
future episodes of the show, this is also one reason why ratings picked up from Season 3 onwards.
The last 2 episodes of final Season are highest rated, as it had re-union of almost all charcaters of the show. <br>

4) **The Big Bang Theory:** We can see that Seasons 1 to 3, got good ratings and audiences were kept engaged with Novelty factor. <br>
But Seasons 4 through 12 don't see pick-up in ratings again. <br>
Although the show had comedy and romantic plots but the main characters were all from science background perhaps this could be a reason of low ratings, as the larger crowd would not be identifying with the main characters much. <br>
    
5) **The Office:** Season 1 was had slow moving plot based only on the inside of a Paper Company office, the audience couldn't connect with it much.
But Season 2 through 7, was really interesting and received consistent high ratings. <br>
One of the important characters of the show left in last episode of Season 7, this explains the sudden drop in ratings of the show for 2 straight seasons i.e. 8th and 9th. <br>
However last 3 episodes of the 9th (last) season got very high ratings, especially the last one as it had a pretty sweet surprise :). Moreover last episode was kind of a redemption time in every character's life, that's why it is held in high regards by the audiences.
